# Final Project for CSIT 355

## Business Plan and Purpose
At our business, we develop websites for your everyday people for affordable pricing. We have a simple business model with no scams, and are upfront about what we charge. We are especially known for our cheap eCommerce websites that are high in quality. Some practices we hold is to hold quality over quantity, staying transparent with our customers, and most of all, keeping security at the forefront of our products.

We have 5 different types of products. Static wallpapers have just one image and that do not move; they just take up one screen. Live wallpapers move around and don’t stay static but are not interactive, they don’t do anything if you perform a certain action. Multi-Screen wallpapers span over multiple screens; in order to cover the whole wallpaper one must swipe to the next screen to complete it. Interactive wallpapers are static until an action is conducted on them; whether it’s “force touching” on your phone or looking at a certain region on your screen, after the action is performed the wallpaper reacts. Hybrid wallpapers constantly are moving and aren’t static but as well are interactive where if you touch them or perform an action they react.
