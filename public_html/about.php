                <p>We have 5 different types of products. <b>Static</b> wallpapers have just one image and that do not move; they 
                just take up one screen. <b>Live</b> wallpapers move around and don‚Äôt stay static but are not interactive, they don‚Äôt
                 do anything if you perform a certain action. <b>Multi-Screen</b> wallpapers span over multiple screens; in order to 
                 cover the whole wallpaper one must swipe to the next screen to complete it. <b>Interactive</b> wallpapers are static 
                 until an action is conducted on them; whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúforce touching‚Äù on your phone or looking at a certain 
                 region on your screen, after the action is performed the wallpaper reacts. <b>Hybrid</b> wallpapers constantly are 
                 moving and aren‚Äôt static but as well are interactive where if you touch them or perform an action they react.</p>
