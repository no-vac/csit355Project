                <h2>About Us üñº</h2>
                <p>At our business, we develop websites for your everyday people for affordable pricing. We have a simple 
                business model with no scams, and are upfront about what we charge. We are especially known for our cheap 
                eCommerce websites that are high in quality. Some practices we hold is to hold quality over quantity, staying
                 transparent with our customers, and most of all, keeping security at the forefront of our products.</p>

                <p>We have 5 different types of products. Static wallpapers have just one image and that do not move; they 
                just take up one screen. Live wallpapers move around and don‚Äôt stay static but are not interactive, they don‚Äôt
                 do anything if you perform a certain action. Multi-Screen wallpapers span over multiple screens; in order to 
                 cover the whole wallpaper one must swipe to the next screen to complete it. Interactive wallpapers are static 
                 until an action is conducted on them; whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúforce touching‚Äù on your phone or looking at a certain 
                 region on your screen, after the action is performed the wallpaper reacts. Hybrid wallpapers constantly are 
                 moving and aren‚Äôt static but as well are interactive where if you touch them or perform an action they react.</p>
